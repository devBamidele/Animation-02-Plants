# 🌱 Flutter Interaction Animation – Plants Concept

This project is a **Flutter recreation** of a motion design by [Sam Atmore (Kiwi Sam)](https://dribbble.com/KiwiSam).  
The goal was to bring a high-fidelity Dribbble interaction into Flutter, focusing on **fluid animations, custom transitions, and smooth user interaction**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
- Recreated the original concept with Flutter.
- Focused on **page transitions, motion timing, and natural interactions**.
- Learned to balance performance with design fidelity in advanced animations.
